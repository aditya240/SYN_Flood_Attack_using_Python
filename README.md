# SYN_Flood_Attack_using_Python

The code is trying to execute a SYN Flood Attack on a Machine. If the SYN Cookie countermeasure is disabled and this code is executed you will not be able to establish a connection with the machine (for example by using telnet, i.e. <telnet {IP_address}>). The connection will time out.
